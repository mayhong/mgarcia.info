    text: "In my beginnings I worked for 3 and a half years with <b>C#</b>, <b>ASP.NET MVC Framework</b> and <b>SQL Server</b>, along with front-end technologies like <b>jQuery</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b> and mobile like <b>Sencha Touch</b>, <b>jQuery Mobile</b> and <b>Apache Cordova</b>. Before leaving my first job as a developer I started developing freelance projects with <b>PHP</b>, the <b>CodeIgniter</b> framework and <b>MySQL</b> as the database, starting at my next job I decided to direct the business to open technologies adopting <b>Laravel</b> PHP framework and <b>Angular</b> for the front-end, <b>Wordpress</b> and <b>Jekyll</b> for websites, <b>Ionic</b> and <b>Apache Cordova</b> for apps and <b>GIT</b> as versioning software. And without a doubt my favorite language is <b>Javascript</b>, so lately I have oriented my learning in technologies based on this one like Node.js, MongoDB and Angular."

  about:
    title: "About me"
    text: "Hi, I'm Mario, I was born and I live in Tijuana, the border with the United States. From an early age, I was very passionate about the computer world, I went to a computer school where I discovered that this was the career I wanted to study, and I did. Before leaving the university I worked at <a href='http://el-mexicano.com.mx' target='_blank'>El Mexicano</a>, a regional newspaper, as a software developer, where I had the opportunity to learn a lot, and after 3 and a half years, together with 2 co-workers, we opened our Digital Marketing company, <a href='http://gestiondigital.mx' target='_blank'>Gestión Digital</a>, where I spent 2 years and learned a lot of Marketing, website development, SEO, etc., but because of differences of opinion with investors I decided to separate from the company and start as a freelancer devoting myself to my passion that is software development and the challenges that this entails."
